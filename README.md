Project Title:
Analysis and pridection of "Mall_Customer.csv" of American mall markets called as phonix mall to find out how many customers are visited to a particular shop.on the basis of this prediction of annual income vs spending score.
Disclaimer :
In this particular dataset we assume annual income as a centroid and spending score from the range 1 to 100 data nodes of the clusters.
Problem Statement :
The American finance market as per the GDP of 2011 'Phonix_Trillums mall' as in the first range of out of 5.The owner of the mall is wants to be exact which particular shop or product search in different kind of clusters in entire mall.
As the Datascience Engineer predict the futuristic financial market for upcomming market GDP rate based on no of Clustures.
The client wants atleast top 5 clustures (shops).

Conclusion :
According to the model basis prediction using machine learning algorith A,L k-clusturing we found that clusture 1 which consist red color is a highest cluster which attach more than 50 data nodes.
References :
The model building algorithm develop for all kinds of clusturation values.
The yellow spots represents centroids which is max to max only 3.
